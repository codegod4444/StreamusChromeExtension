This is a complete work in progress. Right now I'm just putting coding standards in as I think of them.


Coding Guidelines:

Behaviors/Mixins:

- Prefer using behaviors and mixins over prototypical inheritance. It is less error prone and more flexible.
- Mixins and behaviors should be named as an adjective/descriptor. They are 'giving' a state to another entity. 'Tooltipable, Hoverable, Sortable' etc.
